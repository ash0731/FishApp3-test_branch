       \n \n Milkfish (Chanos chanos) is the only species in the Family Chanidae. Its distribution is restricted to either low latitude tropics or the subtropical northern hemisphere along continental shelves and around islands, where temperatures are greater than 20 °C (Red Sea and South Africa to Hawaii and the Marquesas, north to Japan and south to Victoria, Australia; and in the Eastern Pacific from San Pedro, California to the Galapagos).
    </string>
    <string name="tigerdesc">Penaeus monodon mature and breed only in tropical marine habitats and spend their larval, juvenile, adolescent and sub-adult stages in coastal estuaries, lagoons or mangrove areas. In the wild, they show marked nocturnal activity, burrowing into bottom substratum during the day and emerging at night to search for food as benthic feeders. Under natural conditions, the giant tiger prawn is more of a predator than an omnivorous scavenger or detritus feeder than other penaeid shrimp. After molting, the new shell is still soft which causes prawns to become vulnerable and they may subsequently be eaten by their predators or companions. Adults are often found over muddy sand or sandy bottoms at 20-50 m depth in offshore waters.</string>

    <string name="tilapiadesc2">\n Nile tilapia is a tropical species that prefers to live in shallow water. The lower and upper lethal temperatures for Nile tilapia are 11-12 °C and 42 °C, respectively, while the preferred temperature ranges from 31 to 36 °C. It is an omnivorous grazer that feeds on phytoplankton, periphyton, aquatic plants, small invertebrates, benthic fauna, detritus and bacterial films associated with detritus. Nile tilapia can filter feed by entrapping suspended particles, including phytoplankton and bacteria, on mucous in the buccal cavity, although its main source of nutrition is obtained by surface grazing on periphyton mats. </string>

    <string name="greenmusseldesc">The asian green mussel (Perna viridis), also known as the Philippine green mussel, is a bivalve belonging to the family Mytilidae. The mussel is economically important in several countries where it is harvested for food; however it is known to harbor toxins, which are hazardous to human health and cause damage to submerged structures such as drainage pipes. It is native in the Asia-Pacific region and was introduced in the waters of Australia, the Caribbean, Japan, North America, and South America as invasive species via boat hulls and water ballasts. \n \n
Typically lives up to 10 m depth and forms dense populations (up to 35000 individuals per square metre) on a variety of structures including vessels, wharves, mariculture equipment, buoys and other hard substrata. This species is an efficient filter feeder, feeding on small zooplankton, phytoplankton and other suspended fine organism material.
</string>
    <string name="mudcrabdesc">The mud crab or mangrove crab, like the penaeid shrimp is also one of the species that may be harvested together with milkfish in brackish water ponds. However its culture as a crop in itself is fairly recent and probably dates back only to the 1960s. This was when bamboo fencing were used around a brackish water pond to prevent them from crawling out. Culture density is typically low (20,000 per ha or lower). Previously known only as Scylla serrata, four distinct species are now recognized but their nomenclature is still not quite settled.
\n \n Feed used ranges from dead chickens from poultry houses to “trash fish” from capture fisheries or from brackish water ponds such as naturally occurring tilapia which is considered a pond pest. There is no trash fish as such in the Philippines since almost all species, big or small, are utilized as direct human food. </string>

\n Most of the maintenance and repair works in fish farms are devoted to dikes. Practically, the same implements in manual construction work are also
        being used in making repairs of dikes. Digging tools, flatboats, wooden dugouts and rafts are most appropriate for work like digging out trenches
        and backfilling them with puddled soil to repair leakage/seepage, and for deepening canals and other similar jobs.
        \n \n
        Maintenance of digging tools is easily done by cleaning and rubbing with oil or grease to prevent them from rusting. Boats should be protected against
        the sun by putting them under the shed. Dugout boats, when not used, may also be filled with water to prevent the walls from cracking when exposed
        under the sun. \n \n
    </string>
    <string name="tools1b">
        \n
        Practical and simple equipment have also been devised for levelling fishpond bottoms. The simple manual mud rake is a good example,
        while in Indonesia, a levelling board manned by four or more men is also used.

    <string name="tools1c">
        \n
        For manual removal of silt in fishpond bottoms or canals, a simple metallic or wooden shovel has been devised and used in Thailand and Indonesia. If the area to be desilted is extensive, a type of silt or sludge pump can be used.
        This can be a small unit so that it can be portable and can be transferred to the various areas of the pond system.

        The industry has designed various types of nets for use in fishpond operations. The fingerling seine, which is used for catching milkfish
        fingerlings and shrimps juveniles, is a fine-meshed rectangular net, about two to four meters long by one meter wide. It is supported by
        two poles at both ends with floats of wood, rubber or synthetic material on the upper side and sinkers of lead on the opposite side. \n \n
    </string>
    <string name="tools2b">\n A fingerling suspension net is usually a standard equipment in brackishwater fish farms.
        This is a rectangular or square net 2 to 3 meters wide by 3 to 5 meters long. Double line of coarse twine line the margins,
        the net has meshes of 0.5 to 1.0 cm square mesh. It is used to hold fingerlings during counting or before transport. \n \n</string>
    <string name="tools2c">\n
    This is a harvesting net of about 1.5 to 2.0 m wide by 30 to 50 m long.
    It should have a float line at one of the long sides and lead line on the opposite side.
    It is made of coarse thread of nylon with mesh of 4 to 5 cm square mesh. To catch fish,
    this seine is dragged over the pond from one end to the other. The fish are gilled on the net but some jump
    over while small ones pass through the net meshes so that this net is usually used for partial harvesting. \n \n
</string>
    <string name="tools2d">
        \n Fine-meshed nylon or Manila hemp cloths are used as screens on frames on gates.
        These screens are usually framed with the wooden frame set on the gates to reinforce the bamboo screens on the frame. \n \n
        For pipes, a fitting bamboo screen basket is used for milkfish nurseries in the Philippines
        During the early stages of fry rearing, this is further coated with nylon mesh or Manila hemp cloth. Sometimes,
        only a fine-meshed net bag is tied to the water control pipe to screen-off unwanted organisms. \n \n
    </string>
    <string name="tools2e"> \n
        Bagnets so constructed so that their openings could fit the wooden frame for screens on gates are made for use in harvesting.
        These are installed on the frames during low tides when water is drained from the ponds which were previously fully flooded during
        the previous high tide. With the force of the current, the stocks of shrimp from the ponds are led into the bagnet where they are
        collected. These harvesting bags for shrimp are used in the shrimp trapping ponds in Malaysia and in milkfish/shrimp polyculture
        ponds in the Philippines. \n \n

    <string name="tools2f">
        \n The net is a versatile net for fishermen as well as for fish farmers for small-scale
        individual catching or sampling. In fish farm, this net can be used for sampling stock of fish or
        shrimp to monitor growth or for partial harvesting when required. \n \n
    </string>
    <string name="tools2g"> \n
        Bamboo screen traps have been devised for partial harvesting in coastal fishponds, especially for penaeid shrimps.
        In Indonesia, the shrimp fyke (bubu udang) is widely used. This consists of a fabricated catching fyke and an antechamber
        and a leader of bamboo screen set perpendicular to the pond dike. Series of the shrimp fykes may be set in the pond during harvest.
        In the Philippines, a similar trap is used but the catching end is formed in place rather than a pre-devised catching fyke. \n \n

    <string name="tools3a">
        \n Portable water pump is usually used to effect water movement whenever needed in the pond system. This is often necessary when water circulation is needed and the tide condition is not conducive for this operation such as in alleviating stagnation or lack of oxygen.
        \n \n
Paddle wheels set in the ponds can remedy critical oxygen condition. These devices can be powered by electricity or by small portable engines. Better aeration of the pond water may also be accomplished through the gates with the use of the closure slabs.

    <string name="tools3b">
        \n Water and soil analysis kits are now available in the market. For coastal fish farms a set that could monitor dissolved oxygen, salinity, pH, are most essential. Additional useful observations involve nutrient-content (N-P-K), depth of visibility (turbidity), etc. Simple visibility observations can be done using the Secchi disc. Direct salinity readings using refractometers is easy to do but the equipment is quite expensive. Improvised hydrometers may be used after standardizing them with a salinometer (hydrometer) or refractometer.

    <string name="tools4a">
   \n Chilling chamber or box has become a standard facility in coastal fish farms. These are made of concrete, wood or galvanized iron
    sheets forming shallow tanks, square or rectangular in form scarcely 0.5 m deep set within the fishpond premises. It may be 2 to 3 m wide by 3 to 5 m long by 0.4 m deep. During harvest, this is filled with clean water and some crushed ice. The harvested fish or shrimp are placed in this box to wash and chill before packing them for the market.

    <string name="tools4b">
    \n Fertilizer platforms, where the sacks of inorganic fertilizers are placed so that the nutrient substances dissolve slowly into
    the water instead of chemically reacting with pond soil are useful facilities of the fish farm. \n \n
</string>
    <string name="tools4c">
       \n There are a number of devices designed to exclude predators and pests. The crab hook is used to catch mangrove crabs that may have made burrows into the fishpond dike. Eel hooks are used on moist pond bottoms to catch the mud eels that may persist to stay in the pond bottom after harvest. For predatory birds, various scaring devices are used. Lines of white twines are usually set over milkfish nurseries. Scarecrows may be set or other scares such as those using mirrors noise scares, moving scares, etc. A trap has also been devised for the mound-forming mud lobster, Thallasina anomala. \n \n

    <string name="history">Students of aquaculture have advanced various theories on how aqua-culture started. It is noted that all these versions could really be factual but are perhaps applicable in different areas of the world where aquaculture may have started independently from each other. It is only within recent period when means of communication and transportation and exchanges beyond continental and national boundaries were possible that aquaculture development has become unified, intensified and in some cases, integrated.
\n \n Examination of available literature on aquaculture history shows that there are at least 4 theories that may explain the beginnings of aquaculture. These are described in the following paragraphs.
</string>
    <string name="history1">This version on the origin of aquaculture relates the beginnings of this industry to existing natural rivers and streams especially in inland areas. These rivers, in the course of time, develop curves and oxbows which, due to natural topography and physiography of the area, may farther result into long, winding oxbows of varying sizes. As time went on, under varying flood levels that occurred in different years such rivers may have changed their courses, leaving behind the formed oxbows together with the fish and other living organisms in them. Human population along the rivers, who by adaptation are natural fishermen, discovered a good harvest of fish could be derived from these naturally formed oxbows. It was also found that seasonal flooding of these water areas restocked them with fish which again could be harvestable during the ensuing dry season. Taking full advantage of this occurrence, enterprising individuals in the surrounding communities would begin to improve the embankments, enclosing such oxbow areas. Subsequently, in addition to the seasonal natural stock of fish that enter the modified oxbows, additional stock may be planted, thus starting aquaculture management in them. This continued on till complete aquaculture management was attained. Development of this nature is exemplified by extensive low-lying level areas with a network of rivers and a distinct monsoonal, annual rainy and dry period. Bangladesh may be a good example of this type of terrain.</string>
    <string name="history2">Fish and other aquatic products have always been held in high esteem by the early rulers of big empires. At the same time, it was a practice to build water areas as source of water, recreation, or a means of defense around castles. Such water areas were not really intended for rearing fish but some of the rulers demanded fish, regardless of the season so that the responsible officers around these rulers had to provide means to obtain fish even during winter. Due to this necessity, the practice has developed to stock fish caught from natural waters into the water areas constructed around castles or communities. As it turned out, some of the fish planted in these artificial waters were able to survive and grow while others perished. In the course of time, the species that survived and grow such as the common carp were selected for this catch-and-hold system of providing fish. As a further development, stocking of the right amount and kind of fish and feeding them when necessary also developed resulting in actual aquaculture practice. The monasteries of Europe and the palaces of emperors and other rulers exemplified this type of venue for aquaculture development.</string>
    <string name="history3">Many tropical areas of the world are affected by monsoons, one bringing strong rains with some floods and the other the dry season. During the rainy system, the rivers which provided the waterways get swollen and if the watershed was extensive, wide-level lowland places were likewise flooded. Extensive marshlands rich in vegetation and aquatic organisms, including fish, provided wide and favourable habitat for growth and reproduction during the flood season of the year. When the rainy season decreases until it finally stops, the water in these floodlands also gradually receded. As the dry season progressed, the water further receded, draining almost all the flood plains but leaving only spots of deep areas and the rivers with water. These resulted in the concentration of the fish that have grown and reproduced during the wet season into the watered depressions or back into the rivers. Fishermen from the surrounding communities catch fish from these concentrated depressions. At the beginning, most of the fish were caught without regard to size or kind. Later on, the small ones were left behind or gathered and transferred to other rearing areas. If suitable, some of these depressions would be provided with embankments in which culture of suitable fish stock in them was conducted, thus starting aquaculture management which began through the concentration version. The low level extensive plains in the African continent exemplified the environment suitable for this type of management. As a matter of fact, the prevailing practice which could be described mainly as capture fisheries but with some element of culture management have been in existence in such areas.</string>
    <string name="history4">While the first three versions have been observed as developments from inland freshwater areas, this fourth development is characteristic of brackish and marine areas affected by tidal fluctuations. Coastal areas usually abound with coves, lagoons, permanent ponds, enclosed swamps or even depressions which were periodically watered and fully or partially drained during ordinary or extreme low tides. The population along these coastal communities or owners or leassors of tidal lands with these types of water areas have long realized that these areas were regularly stocked with fin-fish, crustaceans and even mollusks and other aquatic economic resources naturally found in these waters. With this knowledge, they started to install traps that would block the exit of these fish and crustaceans that may have entered the water area during a flood tide. A fisherman realized that by this management, he could be regularly provided with fish for his table and some extra for the market. As time developed, however, and as more fishermen fish in the surrounding waters, the amount trapped in these water areas declined. Therefore, instead of harvesting at each periodic tide fluctuations, the barricade to the watered area was kept in place for some time, say, one to three months before the fish that have entered have grown to good size. Thus starting a primitive form of aquaculture. Later on, actual aquaculture management was developed consisting of providing the necessary dikes for the watered area, excavating and levelling the area to provide more space and stocking additional finfish or crustacean seeds to augment the trapped fish and crustaceans brought in by the tide. This chronology of development was what actually happened in the development of brackish water aquaculture which probably began in Indonesia and spread to the Philippines, and later into Thailand, Malaysia, India and other areas in the world.</string>

    <string name="method1">The first method is the cage system which uses cages that are placed in lakes, ponds and oceans that contain the fish. This method is also widely referred to as off-shore cultivation. Fish are kept in the cage like structures and are “artificially fed” and harvested. The fish farming cage method has made numerous technological advances over the years, especially with reducing diseases and environmental concerns. However, the number one concern of the cage method is fish escaping and being loose among the wild fish population.</string>
    <string name="method2">The second method is irrigation ditch or pond systems for raising fish. This basic requirement for this method is to have a ditch or a pond that holds water. This is a unique system because at a small level, fish are artificially fed and the waste produced from the fish is then used to fertilize farmers’ fields. On a larger scale, mostly in ponds, the pond is self-sustaining as it grows plants and algae for fish food. </string>
    <string name="method3">The third method of fish farming is called composite fish culture which is a type of fish farming that allows both local fish species and imported fish species to coexist in the same pond. The number of species depends, but it is sometimes upwards of six fish species in a single pond. The fish species are always carefully chosen to ensure that species can coexist and reduce competition for food.</string>
    <string name="method4">The fourth method of fish farming is called integrated recycling systems which is considered the largest scale method of “pure” fish farming. This approach uses large plastic tanks that are placed inside a greenhouse. There are hydroponic beds that are placed near the plastic tanks. The water in the plastic tanks is circulated to the hydroponic beds, where the fish feed waste goes to provide nutrients to the plant crops that are grown in the hydroponic beds. The majority of types of plants that are grown in the hydroponic beds are herbs such as parsley and basil.</string>
    <string name="method5">The last type of fish farming method is called classic fry farming this method is also known as “flow through system”. This is when sport fish species are raised from eggs and are put in streams and released.
\n \n There are a number of different fish species that are raised on fish farms, the most common fish species globally raised are salmon, carp, tilapia, catfish and cod.

    <string name="rules">The Philippine Environment Code (1988) provides the foundation for all measures dealing with the Philippine natural environment, encompassing the management of air quality, water, land use, natural resources and waste. The Code, being a framework instrument, provides a chapter on fisheries and aquatic resources and requires the government to establish a system of rational exploitation thereof. The Philippine Fisheries Code (1998) provides for the development, management, conservation and utilization of fisheries and aquatic resources. The Code integrates all laws that are relevant to these issues. Chapter II, Article III (Sections 45-57) of the Code deals with aquaculture. The Implementing Rules and Regulations (1998) provide the procedures and guidelines for the implementation of the Code. The Code is further implemented by numerous Fisheries Administrative Orders (FAOs) on various specific subjects. 

\n \n The Fisheries Code falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. Within the Department, the Undersecretary for Fisheries and Aquatic Resources is responsible for setting policies and formulating standards and for exercising overall supervision. The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquaculture Resources (BFAR) is the agency tasked with the management and development of fisheries and aquatic resources. The Code also creates a National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI), which serves as the primary research arm of BFAR. The functions of BFAR are broadly defined and include - inter alia - the preparation and implementation of the National Fisheries Industry Development Plan, the enforcement of laws and regulations (except in municipal waters) and the monitoring and regulation of import and export of fishery and aquaculture products and of fish processing establishments.

\n \n The Fisheries Code also provides for the establishment of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management Councils (FARMCs) at various levels: national (NFARMC), municipal or city (M/CFARMC), and bays, gulfs, lakes, rivers and dams bounded by two or more municipalities or cities to be known as Integrated FARMC (IFARMC). The NFARMC serves as an advisory/recommendatory body to the Department of Agriculture in policy formulation and the preparation of the National Fisheries Industry Development Plan. The M/CFARMCs assist in the preparation of Municipal Fishery Development Plans and the enforcement of laws and regulations in concerned municipal waters, among other things. The IFARMC has a similar role to the M/CFARMC except that its reach covers more than just one municipality. Fisheries Administrative Order No 196 (2000)  provides detailed guidelines on the creation and implementation of FARMCs.

\n \n Another basic act that is relevant to aquaculture is the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (1997), which prescribes the measures to modernize the agriculture and fisheries sectors in order to enhance their profitability. Whereas the Fisheries Code prioritizes the management, conservation and protection of fisheries and aquatic resources, the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act places priority on increase in production and encourages a rapid shift towards industrialization. The National Agriculture and Fisheries Council (NAFC) assists the Department of Agriculture in the monitoring and coordination of the agriculture and fisheries modernization process.

\n \n Finally, the Reorganization Act of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) (1987) establishes the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB), encompassing the former National Environmental Protection Council, the former National Pollution Control Commission and the former Environmental Center of the Philippines. It also establishes a Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau. It should be noted that the Fisheries Code contains a number of provisions in which the jurisdictions of BFAR and EMB intersect. Such intersections are express, such as the classification of rare, threatened or endangered species of aquatic flora and fauna or the classification of fishery areas, or implied, such as the formulation of an integrated coastal management framework and the setting, monitoring and evaluation of water quality standards.</string>
    
    <string name="rules2">The Fisheries Code defines aquaculture as "fishery operations involving all forms of raising and culturing fish and other fishery species in fresh, brackish and marine areas".</string>

    <string name="rules3">The Fisheries Code requires BFAR to establish a Code of Practice for Aquaculture. Fisheries Administrative Order No. 214 (2001)  establishes such a Code outlining the general principles and guidelines for environmentally-sound design and operation to promote the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry. The Code deals with many of the issues mentioned above including site selection/evaluation, farm design and construction, EIS, water usage, water discharge and sludge/effluent management, use of drugs, chemicals, potentially toxic pesticides and fertilizers, stock selection/stocking practices, introduction of exotic species/GMOs, feed, feed use and management, fish health management, aquaculture data management and incentives.</string>
